Description: Perform fuzzy joins on data frames using approximate string matching.
    Implements all standard join types (inner, left, right, full, semi, anti) with
    support for multiple string distance metrics from the 'stringdist' package
    including Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, and Soundex. Features
    a high-performance 'data.table' backend with 'C++' row binding for efficient 
    processing of large datasets. Ideal for matching misspellings, inconsistent 
    labels, messy user input, or reconciling datasets with slight variations in 
    identifiers. Optionally returns distance metrics alongside matched records.
